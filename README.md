// Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
//
// Use good Object Oriented code: Create a blog object, and a constructor function for articles.
// Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
// Create the markup for an example Article in the DOM, then use jQuery to clone that for each article.
// Your Article prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
// Add basic styles: a css reset, content in a single centered column, reasonable margins, etc.
